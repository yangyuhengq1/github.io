        "abstract": "Benchmarking spatiotemporal database systems requires the definition of suitable datasets simulating the typical behavior of moving objects. Previous approaches for generating spatiotemporal data do not consider that moving objects often follow a given network. Therefore, benchmarks require datasets consisting of such \"network-based\" moving objects. In this paper, the most important properties of network-based moving objects are presented and discussed. Essential aspects are the maximum speed and the maximum capacity of connections, the influence of other moving objects on the speed and the route of an object, the adequate determination of the start and destination of an object, the influence of external events, and time-scheduled traffic. These characteristics are the basis for the specification and development of a new generator for spatiotemporal data. This generator combines real data (the network) with user-defined properties of the resulting dataset. A framework is proposed where the user can control the behavior of the generator by re-defining the functionality of selected object classes. An experimental performance investigation demonstrates that the chosen approach is suitable for generating large data sets.",

Dynamic vehicular origin\u2013destination (OD) flow is a fundamental component of traffic network modeling and its estimation has long been studied. Although ideal observing conditions and behavioral assumptions are often indispensable for estimation, day-to-day traffic recurrences and variations are seldom utilized to improve the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a new method to recover day-to-day dynamic OD flows using both connected vehicle (CV) trajectories and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) observations. The method involves two modules: the first module provides reliable prior OD flows given limited observations, while the second module seeks the optimal estimates based on the prior OD flows. In the first module, linear projection is extended to consider temporal and spatial variation of the CV penetration rate, and non-negative Tucker decomposition (NTD) is adopted to address the data sparsity issue caused by the low CV penetration rate. In the second module, a self-supervised learning model called the latency-constrained autoencoder (LCAE) is established to search for the optimal OD flows according to the priors with given robust latent features. To avoid local minima and ensure consistency between estimates, a novel algorithm called adaptive sub-sample correction (ASC) is proposed and integrated into the optimization process of LCAE, which can iteratively correct the most inconsistent samples based on the day-to-day traffic flow characteristics. The proposed method is examined on an empirical urban arterial network, a calibrated simulation network, and a synthetic large-scale grid network. Our results indicated that the proposed method requires very few AVI detectors and CV trajectories to achieve competitive estimation performance against two benchmark models. Furthermore, general robustness to several factors with respect to observing conditions and data quality was investigated, and satisfactory scalability was also demonstrated in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational cost.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system where the personal route of a user is predicted using a probabilistic model built from the historical trajectory data. Route patterns are extracted from personal trajectory data using a novel mining algorithm, Continuous Route Pattern Mining (CRPM), which can tolerate different kinds of disturbance in trajectory data. Furthermore, a client\u2013server architecture is employed which has the dual purpose of guaranteeing the privacy of personal data and greatly reducing the computational load on mobile devices. An evaluation using a corpus of trajectory data from 17 people demonstrates that CRPM can extract longer route patterns than current methods. Moreover, the average correct rate of one step prediction of our system is greater than 71%, and the average Levenshtein distance of continuous route prediction of our system is about 30% shorter than that of the Markov model based method.",

Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road networks. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories is crucial to the safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles. Although several graph-based models have exhibited substantial progress in acquiring spatiotemporal dependencies among vehicles in the driving environment, the potential for additional exploration in this domain persists. The main reason is that they concentrated on independently capturing the spatial relations and temporal dependencies, neglecting to incorporate the temporal feature into the spatial feature for co-training, which limits their ability to yield satisfactory predictive accuracy. Typically, spatial and temporal correlations are coupled and should be modeled jointly. Inspired by this, a novel dynamic graph neural network with spatial-temporal synchronization (STS-DGNN) for vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed, which constructs the driving scene as dynamic graphs and can jointly extract spatial-temporal features. Specifically, low-order and high-order dynamics of vehicle trajectories are considered collaboratively in a one-stage framework rather than independently modeling the spatial relationship and temporal correlations of vehicles in two-stage models. The proposed model also considers the dynamic nature of graph sequence by utilizing gate recurrent unit (GRU) to update the graph neural network (GNN) parameters dynamically. The spatial-temporal features are subsequently conveyed to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and processed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to generate the ultimate trajectories. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the STS-DGNN model, the model is assessed on three well-known datasets, namely highD, EWAP and UCY. The results confirm that our model performs better at making predictions than cutting-edge models. The visualization results intuitively explain that our method can extract sophisticated and subtle multi-vehicle interactions, resulting in accurate predictions.",

        "abstract": "Inferring travel modes of travelers in the city is important to transportation planning and infrastructure design. Based on the distribution of travel modes, transportation engineers could provide some proper strategies to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. With advanced sensing techniques, it is possible to collect high-resolution GPS trajectory data of travelers and we can infer travel modes using some popular machine learning methods. One of the difficult tasks facing the application of machine learning especially deep learning in travel mode detection is the lack of large, labeled dataset, because to label the trajectory data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, samples of different travel modes are always unbalanced. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of the generative model and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a hybrid travel modes detection model using less labeled trajectory data. Our key contribution is the utilization of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to artificially create some training samples in such a way that it not only increases the required sample size but balances the dataset to improve the accuracy of the detection model. Furthermore, CNN is applied to extract deep features of trajectory data, and then to classify the travel modes. The results show that the highest accuracy (86.70%) can be achieved by the proposed model. In particular, the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy of bus and driving modes because it can solve the small sample size problem. Moreover, the large sample size can provide an opportunity to develop some advanced deep learning models in future studies.",

Wireless Body Sensor Network (BSNs) are wearable sensors with varying sensing, storage, computation, and transmission capabilities. When data is obtained from multiple devices, multi-sensor fusion is desirable to transform potentially erroneous sensor data into high quality fused data. In this work, a data fusion enabled Ensemble approach is proposed to work with medical data obtained from BSNs in a fog computing environment. Daily activity data is obtained from a collection of sensors which is fused together to generate high quality activity data. The fused data is later input to an Ensemble classifier for early heart disease prediction. The ensembles are hosted in a Fog computing environment and the prediction computations are performed in a decentralised manners. The results from the individual nodes in the fog computing environment are then combined to produce a unified output. For the classification purpose, a novel kernel random forest ensemble is used that produces significantly better quality results than random forest. An extensive experimental study supports the applicability of the solution and the obtained results are promising, as we obtain 98% accuracy when the tree depth is equal to 15, number of estimators is 40, and 8 features are considered for the prediction task.",
